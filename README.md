# LavenderHook - QoL DDA Automation Software

LavenderHook is an in-game overlay for the sole purpose of making AFKing
in Dungeon Defenders: Awakened easier by providing tools that automatically
perform actions or help with a few in game issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation

Browse your Dungeon Defenders: Awakened installation directory something like:

`steamapps\common\Dungeon Defenders Awakened`

You may drop the **Engine** folder in and replace files. Otherwise,
manually place the files as follows:

Replace:\
`Dungeon Defenders Awakened\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Ogg\Win64\libogg_64.dll`\
`Dungeon Defenders Awakened\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Ogg\Win64\PluginLoader.ini`

Create Plugins folder and add:\
`Dungeon Defenders Awakened\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Plugins\LavenderUpdater.dll`\
`Dungeon Defenders Awakened\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Plugins\LavenderHook\LavenderHook.dll`

If you dont want to bundle the updater you can instead do this:\
`Dungeon Defenders Awakened\Engine\Binaries\ThirdParty\Plugins\LavenderHook.dll`

After installation, launching the game normally should automatically
load the overlay.

You may also need to install **ViGEmBus** if you want to use the **Virtual Controller**\
it may be downloaded from here:\
`https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/tag/v1.22.0`

## Misc Window

This window has functions that are not directly tied to automation functions but rather QoL
functions.

- **Flash Heal Fix**\
This will simulate a forced cursor in the center of the process. This is mainly to help
Flash Heal not bug out and perform a sideways Flash Heal that does not actually heal
anything when the main cursor is outside of the window.

- - You may configure:\
Hotkey - Up to 2 combo hotkeys to quickly toggle the button. (ESC binds to None.)

- **Always Cursor**\
This will always display a custom cursor in the game. This is mainly used when the player
cursor, specifically in the Summoner's Overlord mode, suddenly becomes invisible and
hard to locate the actual cursor position.

- - You may configure:\
Hotkey - Up to 2 combo hotkeys to quickly toggle the button. (ESC binds to None.)

- **Hide Window**\
This will turn the window invisible and uninteractable (or far off the screen in certain cases)
to keep the window still active and allow the functions and game to progress correctly,
unlike minimizing the game. When enabled, it will display a small notification at the start
telling you that an icon in the system tray will appear that can be used to restore the
window back to its original form.

- - You may configure:\
Hotkey - Up to 2 combo hotkeys to quickly toggle the button. (ESC binds to None.)

## Virtual Controller Window

This window has a on screen controller layout that lets you control the game
or mainly a split screen character.

The window will not connect without ViGEmBus installed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Profiles Window

This window will have an option to create a new profile which will save your
currently active functions into a profile. The next time the profile button is
pressed it will toggle all the functions within the profile.

The Profiles additionally have a adjustable Hotkey button, rename button and 
a delete button.
